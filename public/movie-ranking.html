<h1>The Best Movies According to Jarda</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Osudy dobreho vojaka Svejka</h3>
<p>
  It's traditional Czech movie. It's a comedy. It's said that the movie
  character Svejk is how the Czech people are.
</p>

<h3>Duchacek to zaridi</h3>
<p>
  It's a black and white, comedy too. About asistent of a lower. I like Vlasta
  Burian - he is the actor of the main character.
</p>

<h3>Columbo</h3>
<p>It's American criminal movie series, it's a little bit like comedy.</p>
